# Assignment_1

Thank you professor and TA's for helping. This assignment sure was something.
UPDATE: In class today we discussed a little bit and I requested just a little more time to change some things. I forgot to add LinkedList so I quickly added
that now. Professor gave me the direct permission to change it as fast as possible and get it in. I can talk to him if needed.

The actual gravity was not working too well, so I was told just to more focus on the arraylist/linkedlist implementation.
Arraylist and Linkedlist both seem to function, however the gravity is super finicky on both and didn't want to waste anymore time on that, since I wanted to get this submitted. 

Thank you!
